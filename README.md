# WePairHealth
Code Snippets supporting personal work contributed as referenced on my resume.

PairWork

WePairHealth is a community health worker placement and training platform that allows its members to search for jobs, list their services, take work-related courses, connect with organizations, events, and lectures, and tell their stories about it all. WePairHealth is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code, I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL Server(TSQL), .NET(C#), and VScode(React, CSS, JavaScript) code files.
My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality of the file uploader component and the share story components and functionalities. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities.

● Developed and structured the share story display, managed, and created functionalities from front-end to back-end.

● Tested and reworked the file uploader and its functionality from the front-end to the back-end.

● Created the necessary procedures in SQL Server using T-SQL incorporating joins, foreign keys, and pagination.

● Built the API endpoints with .NET using C# and thoroughly tested with Postman.

● Designed front-end components in VSCode using React, JavaScript, and CSS to maximize UI/UX and overall functionality.

● Third-party help with files came from utilizing Bootstrap, Yup, Formik, and Toastr.
